If you just cloned the repo from github than you have to:
<ol>
<
 <li> 
 Open a terminal and go to /frontend/my-app/ and run 
       <p>npm install<p/>
 <li/>
 Open a terminal and run <source ./backend/bin/activate> , than install the requirements by typing <pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.TXT>
<ol>
If you already did the first step than just run this command into a terminal:

 source ./start_website
 
 start_website is a bash script that activates the developing environment for you, more  precise
 the React Native developing server and the Django backend.So you are ready to go and start coding :>
